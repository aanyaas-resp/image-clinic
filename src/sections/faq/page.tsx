const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "Do I need an appointment, or can I walk in?",
    answer:
      "We recommend booking ahead so our patient relationship manager can prepare for your visit and minimize wait time. You can book via our website or WhatsApp. Walk-ins are welcome when slots are available, but appointments get priority.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens during my first visit?",
    answer:
      "Your first visit starts with a comprehensive skin or hair diagnosis with our dermatologist. We assess your concerns using our diagnostic tools and build a treatment protocol tailored to your skin type, condition, and goals — nothing is one-size-fits-all.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many sessions will I need to see results?",
    answer:
      "This depends entirely on your condition and treatment plan — everything from mild pigmentation to acne scarring responds differently. Your dermatologist will walk you through an expected timeline after your diagnosis, and adjust it as your skin responds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are your treatments safe for Indian skin tones?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our protocols are specifically calibrated for the pigmentation and sensitivity patterns common in Indian skin, which reduces risks like post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation that can occur with generic treatment settings.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer both skin and hair treatments?",
    answer:
      "Yes — Image Clinic covers advanced skin treatments (scars, pigmentation, acne, anti-aging) as well as hair and scalp care, all under dermatologist-guided care rather than separate, disconnected services.",
  },
  {
    question: "What payment options do you accept?",
    answer:
      "We accept cash, all major cards, and UPI. If you're considering a multi-session package, ask our front desk about available payment plans during your consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Where is the clinic located, and what are your hours?",
    answer:
      "We're located in Kailash Garden, New Delhi, and Gurugram. For current operating hours and holiday schedules, please check our contact page or WhatsApp us directly — hours can shift around festivals and holidays.",
